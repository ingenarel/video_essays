Racism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, and all the other types of hate that we humans have for each other, what do
they all have in common?
Thinking that a group of people or individual is on a lesser level than them because they're different

See humans by nature are creatures who like to categorize. Categorize based on opinions, by skin colour, by language,
gender, by what lies inside an individual's pants, their sexual preferences, their likes and dislikes, what they can or
can't do, their social status, income, and I can go on and on.

Humans also like to create tiers based on those categories, and that is one of the main problems.

And when you think that you are better than an individual or a group of people because they're different, you're also
the part of the problem.

Why should we look at the differences? Why should we look at an individual or a group of people and start judging them
based on their differences?

There isn't a real answer to that, except that that is the nature of us humans
