Okay so maybe you need to use software X, and for that, you need to have software Y running in the background

I'm in a situation like that. I use MPD for listening to my music, and I like to use Vesktop from time to time for using
discord. Now I do use a terminal client for discord called Discordo, will probably make a video about it later. But
anyways, I just like to keep Discordo in the background so that I can get my sweet sweet pings while also not stressing
my system that much, because my damn config is really bloated, and it uses an average of 1.6 gigs of fucking ram and a
lot of CPU, now you might say, hey that's not much, but I'm using an 8 gig ram system with a 3.2 GHz CPU that also
overheats and on top of that a 16-18 year old HDD

And yes I do like my bloated Vesktop config, but here's the thing: I also use MPD-Discord-RPC 
And I don't like it running all the time in the background, Because I don't even run Vesktop all the time in the
background

While you might say, hey bro, 15 megabytes of ram usage, that's not bad, you're just a fucking pussy
And to that I say, I don't fucking care, get the fuck out and use your bloated systems

Okay to those that are still are here, thank you gang, you folks are fucking based because you're mentally unstable and
like to manage, or mismanage every single megabyte of ram, like meeeee

Okay here's the thing that I pulled off

Vesktop uses a `.desktop` file so that you can launch it from your application launcher.

You can override your `.desktop` files installed by your packages, if you put a `.desktop` file with the same name in
$HOME/.local/share/applications

Now here's the original
